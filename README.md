# S3Algorithm merge-sort
Small project made with Java (JavaFX) to show how merge-sort works.
It contains a list of items that can be sorted by every propertie they contain.

### Concept
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
